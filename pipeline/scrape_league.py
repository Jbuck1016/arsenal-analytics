"""League-wide backfill: WhoScored -> Supabase.

Reads the league schedule ONCE, then scrapes every PLAYED match that is not
already loaded, one at a time, with a jittered pause between event reads to
stay under WhoScored's anti-bot rate limit.

Design notes (why it's built this way):
  * The block is rate-based, not volume-based. One schedule read up front, then
    a randomised 60-120s gap between per-match event reads, keeps us under it.
  * Idempotent + resumable. "Done" is defined by rows existing in the events
    table inside the requested league and season, NOT by the local JSON cache.
    Re-running only scrapes what's still missing, so an interrupted run resumes.
  * Null cache files (written when a read is blocked) are purged before each
    match so a prior failure re-fetches instead of re-reading an empty file.
  * A consecutive-failure circuit breaker stops the run if we look blocked,
    rather than failing every remaining match for hours. Resume later.

Usage:
  python pipeline/scrape_league.py --list                 # show the plan, scrape nothing
  python pipeline/scrape_league.py                        # backfill all missing played matches
  python pipeline/scrape_league.py --limit 5             # do only the next 5 (good first test)
  python pipeline/scrape_league.py --min-gap 45 --max-gap 90
