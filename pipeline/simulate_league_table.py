"""Monte Carlo league-table simulator for versioned match predictions.

The simulator is deliberately independent of Supabase and the training pipeline. It
accepts a frozen standings snapshot plus remaining fixtures whose score distribution
comes from a model version, then returns an auditable distribution of final tables.

Input fixture example (Poisson score model):
    {"home_team": "Arsenal", "away_team": "Chelsea",
     "expected_home_goals": 1.8, "expected_away_goals": 1.1}

An explicit score distribution can be supplied instead:
    {"home_team": "Arsenal", "away_team": "Chelsea",
     "score_probabilities": [
       {"home_goals": 1, "away_goals": 0, "probability": 0.2}, ...]}

Spain and Italy use completed plus simulated head-to-head results for regular table
ordering. Serie A's tied-points title and 17th/18th playoffs use a disclosed neutral
50/50 prior until a separately validated hypothetical-match model is available.
